Setup Google Colab (if necessary):

If you're using Google Colab, navigate to https://colab.research.google.com/ and log in with your Google account.
Create a new notebook by clicking on "File" > "New notebook" or "File" > "Upload notebook" if you have a notebook file.
Import the necessary libraries:

The code imports the required libraries at the beginning. Ensure these libraries are installed and imported successfully. If any library is missing, install it using !pip install <library_name> in a Colab cell or in your local Python environment.
Set up API Key (if necessary):

If you're using the Google Gemini API for text refinement (refine_text_with_gemini function), make sure you have a valid API key and replace the placeholder API_KEY with your actual API key.
Load the EAST model:

Ensure you have the EAST model file (frozen_east_text_detection.pb) saved in the specified path or adjust the path accordingly. This model is used for text detection.
Define image path and execute main function:

Set the image_path variable to the path of the image file you want to process.
Run the main function with the image path and EAST model path as arguments.
Review the output:

After executing the main function, the code will display the input image with detected text regions highlighted and print the recognized text as well as the refined text.
If you're using Google Colab, the image will be displayed below the cell where you run the main function.
Adjustments and troubleshooting:

If you encounter any errors or unexpected behavior, double-check the paths to the image and model files, ensure all required libraries are installed, and verify that the API key (if used) is valid.
If the code is running on your local machine, make sure you have the necessary permissions to access the files specified in the code.
Execute the code:

Run each cell in the notebook sequentially, ensuring that the necessary setup steps are completed before executing the main function.
Review the output at each step to ensure the code is executing as expected.
By following these steps, you should be able to execute the provided code successfully and analyze the output. If you encounter any issues, feel free to ask for further assistance.
